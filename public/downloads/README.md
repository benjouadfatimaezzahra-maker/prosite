The sample ZIP bundles referenced throughout the app are not checked into the repository to keep the tree lightweight and avoid binary diffs.

In production these archives are generated after purchase and stored in object storage (for example, S3). During local development you can drop placeholder ZIP files in this folder if you want to exercise the download links.
